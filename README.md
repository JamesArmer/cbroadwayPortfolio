## Personal Portfolio for a friend's Design Projects

Live site URL: https://agreeable-forest-0c2491e03.azurestaticapps.net/

A static site built in Next.js using styled components and hosted on Azure.

Created with responsive design in mind to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile.

All videos hosted on YouTube and pictures stored in blob storage which are accessed through Azure CDN for speed in any location. All images stored in the .webp format to reduce size and CDN costs, whilst also reducing load time.
