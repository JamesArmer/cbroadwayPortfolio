Live site URL: www.charlesbroadway.com

A static site built in Next.js using styled components and hosted on Azure.

Made with responsive design in mind to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile.

All videos hosted on YouTube and pictures stored in hot blob storage, accessed through Azure CDN for speed. All images stored in the .webp format to reduce size and CDN costs, while also reducing load time.
