        </SectionQuote>
        <SectionText>
          This design stems from the observation that as our internet
          connections become stronger, our meaningful connections become weaker.

          Throughout our evolution, light has been a key factor in bringing
          people together. We could effectively and beneficially incorporate
          light into a 5G router through the use of LiFi technology.
        </SectionText>
        <SectionText>
          It was therefore thought that this router could encourage the notion
          of bringing people together both physically and digitally. Becoming a
          hub for the home, both online and offline.

          An initial model was made to highlight areas for development in the
          design and to help better understand the interactions users would have
          with their router. This was done by considering the use in a number of
          different scenarios. Performance was beneficial in highlighting
          exactly what features were needed. For example, this resulted in the
          integration of a remote sound function for when a lamp is misplaced
          within the home.

          The form and features were refined and developed. The individual lamps
          or ‘birds’ can be used both on the tree or removed for use elsewhere
          in the home with a secure LiFi connection. They can be positioned in
          any number of arrangements on the ‘tree’ thanks to magnetic charging
          connections. The shades can rotate allowing the user to light their
          environment as they wish and direct their LiFi connection.

          The lamps house components for LiFi in a durable Polycarbonate ABS
          blend, this includes LED’s, antenna, a speaker, magnets and a charging
          connection. The components have been strategically positioned for
          weight distribution and access to the battery so that it can easily be
          replaced.

          LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses the infrared and
          visible light spectrum for high-speed-data communication.
        </SectionText>
        <SectionQuote noPadding>Why is LiFi useful?</SectionQuote>
        <SectionText>
          There are key security advantages. Access to the internet is only
          granted where the light can reach, meaning that people outside of the
          room are not able to eavesdrop on the user which can help relieve
          anxieties when performing tasks such as online banking.
        </SectionText>
        <SectionText>
          The wireless industry and lighting industry will soon merge as these
          technologies together can address the need for enhanced indoor
          coverage by realising a dual-purpose system providing both
          illumination and communication.

          The modularity of the design provides numerous benefits; optimised
          space during transportation, easily assembled by the user and easily
          disassembled at the end of product life.
        </SectionText>
        <SectionText>
          A modular pricing strategy can also be used, where the user can select
          the number of lamps they require and pay accordingly. Also covering
          the ability to return parts if there are repairs or hardware updates.

          By incorporating a lamp, the router becomes an ornament, holding more
          emotional value. This creates a more intimate relationship between the
          user and the router. When combined with empowering the user to build,
          fix and update, this increases the chances that it will be kept for
          longer.
