          An immersive experience in the form of a lunchbox designed to build
          empathy between MHCLG ministers and the residents of substandard
          office-to-residential conversions (during COVID-19 lockdowns), allowed
          by a lack of safeguards in Permitted Development Rights. The lunchbox
          is to be delivered to MHCLG ministers at their offices and through its
          use, allow them to step imaginatively into the worldview of the
          residents.

          Once the lunchbox opens, a soundscape begins to play from it. This
          consists of an ambient track with sounds that some of these families
          would hear building up on top. These sounds build up throughout as
          well as testimonials from residents. It adds another layer to the
          experience, reflecting some of the things experienced by the residents
          such as the lack of privacy, poor locations and large numbers of
          people in a small space. Especially pertinent during the pandemic - if
          someone has a persistent cough or is seriously ill, the entire family
          is kept awake.

          Families must balance many aspects of their lives in a tiny room. They
          sleep, cook, eat and dry laundry in the same space the children play
          and study. This is reflected in the food containers which, must be
          arranged on the given floorplan of a room in Terminus House, Harlow.
          The containers themselves require their lids to stand up and each of
          these parts represent a different aspect of the families’ lives in
          lockdown, therefore showing the necessity to balance these elements on
          top of one another.

          The foods in the lunchbox have been selected to leave a longer-lasting
          impression beyond the lunchbox’s use. Chillies, sardines and sour
          berries for lasting flavours. Tomatoes and beetroot for lasting
          stains, representing marks left from fights in corridors and the
          memories of the residents. The cutlery is attached to either side of
          the tray to be restrictive, much like the four walls of a 18m2 home.
